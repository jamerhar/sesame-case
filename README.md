### Bill of Materials
 |Count|Part|
 |-|-|
 |1|Populated Sesame PCB Assembly|
 |1|Sesame Case|
 |1|Top Mount Sesame Plate|
 |8|Brass Screw-to-Expand Inserts, M2x4mm|
 |8|M2x5mm Button Head Screw|
 |4|Adhesive Rubber Bumpons|
 
 This case currently has just an open bottom, with the original intent to make an acrylic or metal bottom piece. This was never gotten around to and is used as is. There are mounting points for bottom case attachment already in the design. I had my case printed through JLCPCB's resin 3D printing services and was successful with their 8000 resin with no warping present.
 
### Disclaimer
I do not offer any sort of warranty, nor can I be held liable if something goes wrong.
Please thoroughly review the design, especially involving the case, before ordering anything. There are possibly small errors and other defects within the design, this was my first attempt at case design and it is by no means perfect.
